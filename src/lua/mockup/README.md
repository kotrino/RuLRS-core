This file is for development purposes only and provides field definitions for filling the screen in the OpenTX Companion Simulator. Users do not need this file on their handset's SD card!

### Using
Copy the entire mockup directory into the same directory as `rulrsV2.lua` on your hard drive where you've set the OpenTX Companion "SD Structure Path". The SD structure path should look like this:
```
SCRIPTS/TOOLS/rulrsV2.lua
SCRIPTS/TOOLS/mockup/rulrsmock.lua
SCRIPTS/TOOLS/mockup/README.md <- this file
```
When you execute rulrsV2.lua, the screen will be populated with fake RULRS Lua config fields.
